Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Instructions for project The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


setwd("C:/TEMP/UCI HAR Dataset")

###Load required packages
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(tidyr)

###
### Read Files and Create Data Files
###

filesPath <- "C:/TEMP/UCI HAR Dataset"

# Read subject files
dataSubjectTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "subject_train.txt")))
dataSubjectTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "subject_test.txt" )))

# Read activity files
dataActivityTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "Y_train.txt")))
dataActivityTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "Y_test.txt" )))

#Read data files.
dataTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "X_train.txt" )))
dataTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "X_test.txt" )))

###
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
###


# for both Activity and Subject files this will merge the training and the test sets by row binding 
#and rename variables "subject" and "activityNum"
alldataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
setnames(alldataSubject, "V1", "subject")
alldataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
setnames(alldataActivity, "V1", "activityNum")

#combine the DATA training and test files
dataTable <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)

# name variables according to feature e.g.(V1 = "tBodyAcc-mean()-X")
dataFeatures <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "features.txt")))
setnames(dataFeatures, names(dataFeatures), c("featureNum", "featureName"))
colnames(dataTable) <- dataFeatures$featureName

#column names for activity labels
activityLabels<- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "activity_labels.txt")))
setnames(activityLabels, names(activityLabels), c("activityNum","activityName"))

# Merge columns
alldataSubjAct<- cbind(alldataSubject, alldataActivity)
dataTable <- cbind(alldataSubjAct, dataTable)


###
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
###

# Reading "features.txt" and extracting only the mean and standard deviation
dataFeaturesMeanStd <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",dataFeatures$featureName,value=TRUE) #var name

# Taking only measurements for the mean and standard deviation and add "subject","activityNum"

dataFeaturesMeanStd <- union(c("subject","activityNum"), dataFeaturesMeanStd)
dataTable<- subset(dataTable,select=dataFeaturesMeanStd) 



###
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###

##enter name of activity into dataTable
dataTable <- merge(activityLabels, dataTable , by="activityNum", all.x=TRUE)
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)

## create dataTable with variable means sorted by subject and Activity
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)
dataAggr<- aggregate(. ~ subject - activityName, data = dataTable, mean) 
dataTable<- tbl_df(arrange(dataAggr,subject,activityName))

###
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
### Body = related to body movement.
### Gravity = acceleration of gravity
### Acc = accelerometer measurement
### Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
### Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
### Mag = magnitude of movement
### mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. The units given are gâ€™s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

head(str(dataTable),2)

names(dataTable)<-gsub("std()", "SD", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("mean()", "MEAN", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(dataTable))
# Names after
head(str(dataTable),6)

###
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
### 

write.table(dataTable, "TidyData.txt", row.name=FALSE)
